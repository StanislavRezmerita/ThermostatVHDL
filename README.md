This project is a basic thermostat developed as part of the Introduction to VHDL course during laboratory work. The primary goal was to apply fundamental VHDL concepts to design and simulate a functional digital system.

Overview
    The thermostat simulates a simplified temperature control system, designed to:
        Monitor temperature inputs.
        Compare the current temperature to preset thresholds.
        Activate or deactivate heating or cooling mechanisms based on conditions.
Features
    Temperature Monitoring: Accepts simulated temperature input values.
    Threshold Comparison: Defines upper and lower temperature limits.
    Control Logic: Activates heating or cooling signals depending on the temperature range.
